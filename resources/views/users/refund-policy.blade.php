(a)  In the event of an accident there is NO OBLIGATION to either supply another vehicle or provide a refund for the balance of the hire term. Providing a replacement vehicle is entirely at the vehicle owner’s discretion, but if the accident is not the hirers’ or nominated drivers’ fault then we may provide a replacement (subject to bookings), again this is at our discretion.
(b) In the event that the hirer wishes to terminate early. There is NO OBLIIGATION to provide a refund for the balance of the hire period. However, a refund may be provided in the event of “extenuating circumstances or on compassionate grounds”.
